# Gesture-Controlled Robot Car 
Similarly to how TV shows and movie series animate powers which can move objects without manually holding them, I am working on a robot car which can move according to different hand gestures. Controlled by an Arduino, the gestures are registered through a makeshift glove. From here, it is then transmitted to the car, enabling it to move in different directions according to my hand gestures.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to understand the functioning of motors and motor drivers, and how I can implicate those into my robot car. Starting off, I downloaded the Arduino coding software, which I would use ot code the different commands that I wish my robot to execute. Moving on to the car, I began with working on powering only two motors/wheels, color-coding the different jumper wires used to connect the motors to the motor-driver outputs. From there, I plugged in a battery pack as my power source, while using a jumper wire to manually turn on each motor and drive in different directions. Due to its success, I added two more motors, stuffing the extra sets of jumper wires into the motor-driver outputs. However, instead of powering it manually, I used Arduino to code a simple code which would move all 4 tires simultaneously at a fixed speed. Once finished,  I disassembled the parts of my prototype and transferred the pieces onto a chassis, where I reassembled the pieces to complete my first milestone.
